    <div class="entry" data-title="Domain of Inanna" data-category="WDP">
      <h2>Domain of Inanna</h2>
      <p>The Domain of Inanna is an old nation, coming into the world when most lands were unclaimed by formal countries. It was born in the Middle East, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. 
The nation is ruled by a class of high priestesses that are said to be able to commune with the goddess Inanna. As the domain has expanded, more high priestesses have been added to the ranks. 
Each high priestess rules from a palatial temple atop a large ziggurat. These ziggurats can be seen dotted across domain lands, sometimes topped with a large flag that can be seen for miles.
As the Domain expanded, it first came into contact with the Kingdom of Ra to the west, with whom the domain quickly became allied. 
As expansion continued, boarder wars took place in Anatolia with the LPR. After a major war with the LPR, the independent nation of Alban was annexed into the Domain, and the boarder shifted slightly with the LPR. 
After the collapse of the LPR, the domain reclaimed lost land and occupied several former LPR provinces. 
In the east, the Domain established two puppet states organized under the Alban banner. These puppet states were designed to guard against the Red Gold Khanate that was rampaging wildly across Asia. When the Khanate was conquered into modern China, these boarder states lost their relevance and much of their territory was ceded to Euruska to maintain peace. 
Beyond Mesopotamia, the domain has settled many colonies. They have longstanding colonies in North Africa, and Brazil to the west, and the new continents discovered across the ocean beyond Japan to the east. 
The Domain was also one of the First Nations to colonize the moon. From there, the Domain made the strategic decision to ignore the land rush for Mars and instead colonize the mineral rich Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos. The Domain maintains sole occupation of these two moons. 
On Earth, the Domain also maintains the largest naval fleet in the world, with many vessels all over the planet.</p>
